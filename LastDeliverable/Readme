User 1: Devon Hayworth
Modified the “echo_s” code so that an argument is passed to indicate what IP address
the log server is running at.

User 2: Ryan Corcoran
Modified the “echo_s” code so that an additional argument is passed to indicate what
port address the log server is running at. 

User 3: Henry Tran
Modified the “log_s” code so that an additional argument is passed to indicate
what port address it should listen on.

User 4: Jacob Cherry
Modified both “echo_s” and “log_s” code so that “echo_s” will send a special
message “echo_s is stopping” when the “echo_s” is stopped with “ctrl+c”. “log_s” does not log this message, but rather terminates. 

User 5: Ian Llewellyn
Modified the “log_s” code so that it will log the special message “echo_s is
stopping” when it receives it from the server, then terminate.

User 6: Adrian Rivera-Zayas
Modified the “Readme” with all the changes that were made by all the users. Documented what each user did. The Readme also has the name of the github repo. 
Verified that the code works, and that it is well documented.
